```

## Schemas

### Account ID

Each account has an ID associated, this ID is the hex encoded bytes, generated by concatenating
the account username and account site then running the SHA256 algorithm on the string, to ensure
uniqueness of the password (each site can have multiple usernames, but each username of the site
can only have 1 associated password.)

### Password

Passwords are ciphered/deciphered with an AEAD algorithm
[Chacha20 Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305), that combines the ChaCha20
stream cipher with the Poly1305 message authentication code. It is optimized for software
performance without hardware acceleration.
